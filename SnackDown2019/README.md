# Q1- Qualifying to Pre-elimination

Today the organizers ask you to count the number of qualified teams in Pre-elimination round.They provide you scores of each team and ensure that all teams scoring at least equal to K-th team.

**Input:**

1. The first line contains one integer T - the number of testcases. The next 2⋅T lines contains test cases.
2. The first line of each test case contains two integers - N and K.
3. The second line contains N space-separated integers Si, i-th of them denoting the score of i-th team.

**Output:** For each testcase, output in a single line containing the answer to the problem.

**Constraints**
* 1≤T≤1000
* 1≤K≤N≤10^5
* 1≤S[i]≤10^9
* sum of N over all test-cases doesn't exceed 10^6

# Q2- Chef and Semi-Primes

Chef likes prime numbers. However, there is one thing he loves even more. Of course, it's semi-primes!! Semi-prime number is an integer which can be presented as a product of two distinct primes.Chef is wondering to check if an integer can be presented as a sum of two semi-primes. Help Chef with this tough task!

**Input**

* First line will contain T, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow.
* Each testcase contains one integer N in a single line.

**Output**

For each testcase output in a single line "YES" if possible to present N as the sum of two semi-primes and "NO" otherwise.

**Constraints**
* 1≤T≤200
* 1≤N≤200
